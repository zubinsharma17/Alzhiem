# Alzhiem
This is a Project aiming to help the people suffering from Alzheimers. It includes a camera to identify the person in front of an Alzheimerâ€™s patient to help recognize them how they are related to the patient.It uses OpenCV and HaarCascading ,etc.
It will create a data set on its Own from the Camera.
#Note: this will not work from the beginning as it needs to be trained firse and needs camera attached for it to work properly.
